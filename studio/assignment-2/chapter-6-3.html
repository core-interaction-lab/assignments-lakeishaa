                        Burnett cut. Kriere’s milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen, eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.<br><br>
                        “We’re about fifty miles from him, catching up.” Burnett turned to Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.<br><br>
                        If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that⁠—<br><br>
                        Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat, water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored because of his gun.<br><br>
                        Kriere would make odds impossible. <br><br>
                        Something had to be done before Kriere came in.<br><br>
                        Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered, fooled⁠—somehow. But⁠—how?<br><br>
                        Burnett’s jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew, artery⁠—heart.<br><br>
                        There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and this would be the last trip.<br><br>
                        Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.<br><br>
                        “Steady, Rice,” he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in the center of that silence. “Take controls, Rice. I’ll manipulate the star-port.”<br><br>
                        Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly. Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first, why⁠—<br><br>
                        Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation. Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about to be rescued.<br><br>
                        Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn’t know was that he was about to end a ten-years’ war.<br><br>
                        There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be fast.<br><br>
                        Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett’s easily fingered directions, slid the long clawlike mechanism that picked up bodies from space.<br><br>
                        Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet, too.<br><br>
                        The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dreamlike in its slowness.<br><br>
                        It reached Kriere.<br><br>
                        Burnett inhaled a deep breath.<br><br>
                        The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.<br><br>
                        Lethla watched.<br><br>
                        He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: “You know, Lethla, there’s an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation. I believe it.”<br><br>
