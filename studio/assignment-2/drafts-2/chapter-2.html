                      Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed up into the airlock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed without making any noise on the rungs. <br><br>
                      He kept thinking the one thing he couldn’t forget.<br>
                      You never catch up with the war.<br><br>
                      All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited glory are always a million miles ahead.
                      He bit his teeth together.<br><br>
                      You never catch up with the war.<br><br>
                      You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see it; you don’t hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your ribs.<br><br>
                      You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the airlock.<br><br>
                      That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.<br><br>
                      You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be. After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing your job with mechanical hands.<br><br>
                      But even a machine breaks down.⁠ ⁠…<br><br>
