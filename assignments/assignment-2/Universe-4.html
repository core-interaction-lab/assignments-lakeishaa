                        >An explosion called the "boom boom", had occurred, separating those who had survived into two groups; those who accepted the 'new truth', and those who kept the old beliefs from before the change. Radiation rotted away those who believed in the old, causing them to appear mutated and become attracted to advertisements on billboards. Those who accepted the 'new truth' inhabited the desert, hunting down those who believed in the old.

                        Summer, Rick and Morty teleported to this dimension to go on a dangerous adventure, in attempt to escape talking to Jerry Smith.
                        
                        The setting of the dimension is heavily influenced by the Mad Max franchise. It is unknown if this dimension has any version of the Smith/Sanchez family. After the finale Season 5, it became known that all the events of the series were in the Central Finite Curve, in which only those universes where Rick is the smartest creature are located. This means that the Sanchez/Smith family still existed in this universe, but either they are dead or left this universe due to the apocalypse.
