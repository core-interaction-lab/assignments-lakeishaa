                        >Dimension C-137 (pronounced "see one thirty seven") is one of the many universes in the multiverse, and the original universe where the mainstream Rick was born and grew up. This is one of many dimensions where Rick's wife Diane and daughter Beth were killed when Beth was a child, and as a result, Summer and Morty never existed. Before it was revealed that the Rick and Morty we follow in the show are each from different dimensions, "Dimension C-137" was thought, including by Morty himself, to refer to the Cronenberged dimension where our Morty originated and the first six episodes of the TV series took place.

                        >Dimension C-137 is first mentioned in "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind", by the Council of Ricks. Morty also refers to himself as "from Dimension C-137", unaware that he is not from the same dimension as Rick.

                        Dimension C-137 is briefly mentioned in "Mortynight Run", when Rick is asked to identify his home dimension for identification purposes when returning to pick up his Jerry. Because Jerry is not from Rick and Morty's home dimension of C-137, Rick marks him as "N/A". This might mean that Rick is (or was) uncertain of their current dimension's official alphanumeric identification.
                        
                        Dimension C-137 is mentioned in "The Rickshank Rickdemption". When several Ricks from the Citadel capture Morty and Summer in the Cronenberged dimension, Morty identifies himself as "Morty C-137", which causes two of the Ricks to look at one another and take pause, likely because it is common knowledge there is no naturally occurring "Morty C-137" in existence. Other Council members again refer to Rick as "C-137", meaning Rick has been accurately (and intentionally) identifying himself as such.
